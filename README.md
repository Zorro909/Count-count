### A disclaimer
this whole thing is a mess.

# whats it actually do?
* using `=fetch` causes the bot to count all the messages in the channel and tell you how many that are, how many were yours, and your percentage.
* using `=count` makes the bot count up once, and writes the number to a file. this file is globally shared so everyone can colleberatively go for the stars.
* using `=fetch1` or `=fetch2` is **stupid** since they suck and shouldn't even be in the code. feel free to experiment if you like to torment yourself.
* using `=log` doesn't do anything usefull yet, just shows you how many times the bot has spoken in the channel for the past 200 message.

# what's next?
